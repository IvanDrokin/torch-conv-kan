## Introducing Convolutional KAN layers

Kolmogorov-Arnold networks rely on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem:

![Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem](assets/math/kart.png)

So, from this formula the authors of [KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) derived the new architecture: learnable activations on edges and summation on nodes. MLP in opposite performs fixed non-linearity on nodes and learnable linear projections on edges. 

![KAN vs MLP](assets/math/mlp_vs_kans.png)

In a convolutional layer, a filter or a kernel "slides" over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication. The results are summed up into a single output pixel. The kernel performs the same operation for every location it slides over, transforming a 2D (1D or 3D) matrix of features into a different one. Although 1D and 3D convolutions share the same concept, they have different filters, input data, and output data dimensions. However, we'll focus on 2D for simplicity.

Typically, after a convolutional layer, a normalization layer (like BatchNorm, InstanceNorm, etc.) and non-linear activations (ReLU, LeakyReLU, SiLU, and many more) are applied.

More formal: suppose we have an input image y, with N x N size. We omit channel axis for simplicity, it adds another summations sign. So, first we need to convolve it with out kernel W with size m x m:

![convolutional operation](assets/math/conv.png)

Then, we apply batch norm and non-linearity, for example - ReLU:

![batch norm and non-linearity](assets/math/nonlin.png)

Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutions work slightly differently: the kernel consists of a set of univariate non-linear functions. This kernel "slides" over the 2D input data, performing element-wise application of the kernel's functions. The results are then summed up into a single output pixel. More formal: suppose we have an input image y (again), with N x N size. We omit channel axis for simplicity, it adds another summations sign. So, the KAN-based convolutions defined as:

![Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutions](assets/math/kan_convs.png)

And each phi is a univariate non-linear learnable function. In original paper, the authors propose to use this form of the functions:

![Kolmogorov-Arnold Phi](assets/math/spline.png)

And authors propose to choose SiLU as b(x) activation: 

![Kolmogorov-Arnold SiLU](assets/math/silu.png)

To sum up, the "traditional" convolution is a matrix of weights, while Kolmogorov-Arnold convolutions are a set of functions. That's the primary difference. The key question here is - how should we construct these univariate non-linear functions? The answer is the same as for KANs: B-splines, polynomials, RBFs, Wavelets, etc.

In this repository, implementation of the following layers presented:

- The `KANConv1DLayer`, `KANConv2DLayer`, `KANConv3DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on Kolmogorov Arnold Network, introduced in [1]. Baseline model implemented in `models/baselines/conv_kan_baseline.py`.

- The `FastKANConv1DLayer`, `FastKANConv2DLayer`, `FastKANConv3DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on Fast Kolmogorov Arnold Network, introduced in [3]. Baseline model implemented in `models/baselines/fast_conv_kan_baseline.py`.

- The `KACNConv1DLayer`, `KACNConv1DLayer`, `KACNConv1DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on Kolmogorov Arnold Network with Chebyshev polynomials instead of B-splines, introduced in [4]. Baseline model implemented in `models/baselines/conv_kacn_baseline.py`.

- The `KAGNConv1DLayer`, `KAGNConv1DLayer`, `KAGNConv1DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on Kolmogorov Arnold Network with Gram polynomials instead of B-splines, introduced in [5]. Baseline model implemented in `models/baselines/conv_kagn_baseline.py`.

- The `KAJNConv1DLayer`, `KAJNConv2DLayer`, `KAJNConv3DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on Jacobi Kolmogorov Arnold Network, introduced in [7] with minor modifications.

- We introduce the `KABNConv1DLayer`, `KABNConv2DLayer`, `KABNConv3DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on Bernstein Kolmogorov Arnold Network.

- The `KABNConv1DLayer`, `KABNConv2DLayer`, `KABNConv3DLayer` classes represents a convolutional layers based on ReLU KAN, introduced in [8].

### Introducing Bottleneck Convolutional KAN layers

As we previously discussed, a phi function consists of two blocks: residual activation functions (left part of diagrams below) and learnable non-linearity (splines, polynomials, wavelet, etc; right part of diagrams below). 

![ConvKANvsBNConvKAN](assets/math/conv_kan_vs_bottleneck_conv_kan.png)

The main problem is in the right part: the more channels we have in input data, the more learnable parameters we introduce in the model. So, as a Bottleneck layers in ResNets, we could do a simple trick: we can apply 1x1 squeezing convolution to the input data, perform splines in this space, and then apply 1x1 unsqueezing convolution.

Let's assume, we have input **x** with 512 channels, and we want to perform ConvKAN with 512 filters. First, conv 1x1 projects **x** to **y** with 128 channel for example. Now we apply learned non-linearity to y, and last conv 1x1 transforms **y** to **t** with 512 channels (again). Now we can sum **t** with residual activations.

In this repository, implementation of the following bottleneck layers presented:

- The `BottleNeckKAGNConv1DLayer`, `BottleNeckKAGNConv2DLayer`, `BottleNeckKAGNConv3DLayer` classes represents a bottleneck convolutional layers based on Kolmogorov Arnold Network with Gram polynomials instead of B-splines.

- The `BottleNeckKAGNConv1DLayer`, `BottleNeckKAGNConv2DLayer`, `BottleNeckKAGNConv3DLayer` classes represents a bottleneck convolutional layers based on Kolmogorov Arnold Network with Gram polynomials instead of B-splines.

## Model Zoo

### ResKANets

We introduce ResKANets - an ResNet-like model with KAN convolutions instead of regular one. Main class ```ResKANet``` could be found ```models/densekanet.py```. Our implementation supports blocks with KAN, Fast KAN, KALN, KAGN and KACN convolutional layers.

After 75 training epochs on CIFAR10 ResKANet 18 with Kolmogorov Arnold Legendre convolutions achieved 84.17% accuracy and 0.985 AUC (OVO).

After 75 training epochs on Tiny Imagenet ResKANet 18 with Kolmogorov Arnold Legendre convolutions achieved 28.62% accuracy, 55.49% top-5 accuracy, and 0.932 AUC (OVO).

Please, take into account that this is preliminary results and more experiments are in progress right now.

We introduce DenseKANets - an DenseNet-like model with KAN convolutions instead of regular one. Main class ```DenseKANet``` could be found ```models/reskanet.py```. Our implementation supports blocks with KAN, Fast KAN, KALN, KAGN and KACN convolutional layers.

After 250 training epochs on Tiny Imagenet DenseNet 121 with Kolmogorov Arnold Gram convolutions achieved 40.61% accuracy, 65.08% top-5 accuracy, and 0.957 AUC (OVO).

Please, take into account that this is preliminary results and more experiments are in progress right now.

### VGGKAN

We introduce VGGKANs - an VGG like models with KAN convolutions instead of regular one. Main class ```VGG``` could be found ```models/vggkan.py```. Model supports all types of KANs Convolutional layers.

Pretrained on Imagenet1k ckeckpoints:

| Model | Accuracy, top1 | Accuracy, top5 | AUC (ovo) | AUC (ovr) |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| [VGG KAGN 11v2](https://huggingface.co/brivangl/vgg_kagn11_v2)|      59.1      |      82.29     |   99.43   |   99.43   |
| [VGG KAGN 11v4](https://huggingface.co/brivangl/vgg_kagn11_v4)|     61.17     |      83.26     |   99.42   |   99.43   |

More checkpoints are coming, stay tuned. Available for me computational resources are pretty limited, so it takes some time to train and eval all models.

## Discussion

First and foremost, it should be noted that the results obtained are preliminary. The model architecture has not been thoroughly explored and represents only two of many possible design variants.

Nevertheless, the experiments indicate that Kolmogorov-Arnold convolutional networks outperform the classical convolutional architecture on the MNIST dataset, but significantly underperform on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 in terms of quality. The ChebyKAN-based convolution encounters stability issues during training, necessitating further investigation.

As a next step, I plan to search for a suitable architecture for KAN convolutions that can achieve acceptable quality on CIFAR-10/100 and attempt to scale these models to more complex datasets.

        self.drop = nn.Dropout(p=0.25)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.layers(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.drop(x)
