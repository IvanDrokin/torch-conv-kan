class SparseDispatcher(object):
    """Helper for implementing a mixture of experts.
    The purpose of this class is to create input minibatches for the
    experts and to combine the results of the experts to form a unified
    output tensor.
    There are two functions:
    dispatch - take an input Tensor and create input Tensors for each expert.
    combine - take output Tensors from each expert and form a combined output
      Tensor.  Outputs from different experts for the same batch element are
      summed together, weighted by the provided "gates".
    The class is initialized with a "gates" Tensor, which specifies which
    batch elements go to which experts, and the weights to use when combining
    the outputs.  Batch element b is sent to expert e iff gates[b, e] != 0.
    The inputs and outputs are all two-dimensional [batch, depth].
    Caller is responsible for collapsing additional dimensions prior to
    calling this class and reshaping the output to the original shape.
    See common_layers.reshape_like().
    Example use:
    gates: a float32 `Tensor` with shape `[batch_size, num_experts]`
    inputs: a float32 `Tensor` with shape `[batch_size, input_size]`
    experts: a list of length `num_experts` containing sub-networks.
    dispatcher = SparseDispatcher(num_experts, gates)
    expert_inputs = dispatcher.dispatch(inputs)
    expert_outputs = [experts[i](expert_inputs[i]) for i in range(num_experts)]
    outputs = dispatcher.combine(expert_outputs)
    The preceding code sets the output for a particular example b to:
    output[b] = Sum_i(gates[b, i] * experts[i](inputs[b]))
    This class takes advantage of sparsity in the gate matrix by including in the
    `Tensor`s for expert i only the batch elements for which `gates[b, i] > 0`.
